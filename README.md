# Registration and Login System

A simple registration and login system demo using opensource projects like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and an authentication middleware called [Passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org/). The authentication process also includes encryption of Password using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) an NPM module.

## Tech
This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - The best MongoDB experience. Access data directly from your frontend code, intelligently distribute data for global apps, trigger serverless functions in response to data changes, and much more.
- [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/) - provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) - is an opensource password hashing function implementation on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- And many more...
